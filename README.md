# Project "Analysis of the activities and development of four companies"

I have data on the activities of four companies.

I need to analyze them and do conclusions with visualization via Jupyter Notebook.

Conclusions:
- determine which company has the largest number of registered accounts.
- calculated % of the total number of accounts.
- identified popular platforms which users used.
- looked at summa orders and GMV.
